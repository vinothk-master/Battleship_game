# Battleship_game
Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game that challenges players to outsmart their opponents by strategically placing and attacking a fleet of ships on a grid. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

Gameplay Overview:
Setup:
Each player has their own grid (e.g., 10x10) to arrange their fleet of ships in secret.
Ships vary in size (e.g., Aircraft Carrier: 5 squares, Battleship: 4 squares, Cruiser: 3 squares, Submarine: 3 squares, and Destroyer: 2 squares).
Ships must be placed horizontally or vertically without overlapping.

Taking Turns:
Players take turns guessing a location on the opponent's grid by calling out a coordinate (e.g., "B5").
The opponent must respond with "Hit" (if a ship occupies that square) or "Miss" (if the square is empty).
If a ship is hit on all its squares, it is considered "sunk," and the opponent announces which ship has been sunk.


Winning the Game:
The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

Game Features:

Strategy: Plan your ship placements to make them difficult to find and predict your opponent’s moves based on their guesses.
Luck: Even with strategy, some guesses rely on chance, making every game unique and exciting.
Adaptability: Adjust your guesses as you learn where the opponent’s ships might be located.

Variants:
Advanced Rules: Some versions include additional features, such as special attacks or different ship types.
Digital Battleship: Many digital versions of the game include animations, sound effects, and additional challenges.
Battleship is a timeless game that combines logic, deduction, and suspense, making it enjoyable for players of all ages.
